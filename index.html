			<h2>Lightning Talk and Map Gallery Submissions are Open!</h2>
   			<h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
					<p>The 3C GIS Day(s) planning committee invites submissions for lightning talks (~10 minutes) from any faculty, staff, or students affiliated with one of the three organizing institutions. We encourage submissions from any discipline that uses geospatial information in any format, such as agriculture and environmental sciences, geography, engineering, business, health sciences, urban planning, and the humanities and social sciences more broadly. We especially encourage submissions from graduate and undergraduate students who would like to showcase their work through a fun and informal presentation opportunity.</p>
					<p>Please submit your lightning talk proposal by <strong>Friday, October 15</strong>: Lightning Talk Submission Form.</p>
       
				<h3>Map Gallery</h3>
					<p>We also invite any affiliated faculty, staff, or students to showcase their original cartographic work through a submission to our digital map gallery. Submission categories include <em><strong>static maps</strong></em> (e.g., from a conference poster or publication) and <em><strong>interactive maps</strong></em> (e.g., story maps, dashboards, and other web mapping applications). Help us highlight the great geospatial projects happening across our institutions!</p>
					<p>Please submit your map gallery entry by <strong>Friday, November 5</strong>: Map Gallery Submission Form.</p>
