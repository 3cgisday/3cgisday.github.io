    	<h2>Map Gallery Submissions are Open!</h2>
    		<p>We invite any faculty, staff, or students affiliated with Case Western Reserve University, The Ohio State University, and the University of Cincinnati to showcase their original cartographic work through a submission to our digital map gallery and competition. Help us highlight the great geospatial work happening across our institutions! </p>
      
      <h3>Submitting an Entry</h3>
        <p>Submission categories include <strong>static maps</strong> (e.g., from a conference poster or publication) and <strong>interactive maps</strong> (e.g., story maps, dashboards, and other web mapping applications).</p> 
				<p>Please submit your map gallery entry by <strong>Friday, November 5</strong>: <a href="https://forms.gle/7W8UwD2iekLgAotx5">Map Gallery Submission Form</a>.</p>
				<p>If you have questions, please contact <a href="mailto:geospatial@osu.edu">geospatial@osu.edu</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Participants can submit multiple entries for display in the map gallery, though a separate form should be completed for each. All entries will be considered for awards, but the same participant <strong>cannot</strong> win multiple awards.</p>
      
      <h3>Awards</h3>
        <p>For each of the major submission categories (static maps and interactive maps), one first prize ($100) and one “people’s choice” ($50) will be awarded. Depending on the number of entries, the organizing committee may decide to award additional winners for other categories. Award winners will also be recognized on the 3C GIS Day(s) event website.</p>
        <p>We thank the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA) at Ohio State for their generous support.</p>
      
      <h3>Specifications</h3>
        <p>Map gallery submissions can include <strong>static maps</strong> (e.g., from a conference poster or publication) and <strong>interactive maps</strong> (e.g., story maps, dashboards, and other web mapping applications). Your submission can be based on a research project, class assignment, or other original concept. We encourage originality and creativity, but please remember to keep it appropriate. Your map gallery submission should feature your own cartographic work. The use of third-party data or applications is permitted with appropriate citation.</p>
      
      <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
        <p>Map gallery submissions will be judged on the following criteria for award consideration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> This criterion considers how innovative the map is. Is the concept unique and different? Have you seen many maps like this before?</li>
            <li><strong>Cartographic Design:</strong> This criterion considers artistic merit, cartographic presentation, and clarity of communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This criterion considers the potential real-world impact of the map. Does it seek to solve or help viewers understand an important problem in society?</li>
            <li><strong>Wow Factor:</strong> This criterion considers a viewer’s reaction to the map. Was there anything extra impressive about the amount of work, complexity, originality, etc.?</li>
          </ul>
